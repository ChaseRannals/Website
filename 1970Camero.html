                <p> This was my favorite car growing up.  I have always wanted one but have only seen a handful of these cars in person.  
                    My opinion is this car is all around the best looking camero ever made.  I personally like the split bumper over the full bumper.  It looks alittle more aggressive to me and seems to fit the look of the car very well.</p>
