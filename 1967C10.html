            <p>I like this truck because I owned one when I was in Highschool.  I learned alot about mechanics while I owned this truck.  I drove it daily to and from school and work.
            I had a 1967 Chevy Stepside C10 with a 4 speed manual transmission.  I like this truck because it was the first vehicle that I ever bought with my own money.  Plus it looks 
            amazing whenever you have them fixed up a bit.</p>
